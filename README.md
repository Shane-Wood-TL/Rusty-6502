# Rusty-6502
Emulating a 6502 in Rust

All Original commands of the 6502 have been implemented. <br>
Test cases for all instructions also exist, while they do not test all possible outcomes, there is a at least one version for every instruction of every addressing type with pc (page crossed) and npc (no page crossed) detection.
